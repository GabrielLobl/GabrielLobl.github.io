              This app is the first iOS app I ever made. It's a simple app, but the satisfaction I had when I completed it was huge. The app is basically a virtual dice which you can use to play board games, casino games or just get a random number. The app has the option to roll just one die or a pair of dice. I personally use it while playing monopoly with my family, but it's great for any occasion.

            <p><span class="center">Shape Calculator</span><br><br>
            After submitting The Dice to the App Store, I wanted to challenge myself by making something bigger, something more complex. I learned how to perform math operations with code and I knew I had to use this knowledge in my next app. I decided to make an app that would calculate the geometrical properties of shapes by using simple formulas. For example, you could calculate the area of a circle, by just providing the radius. I worked in the app for weeks until I finally completed it. It's totally free and you can check it out <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/shape-calculator/id1024154058?mt=8"><i>here</i></a>.

            <p><span class="center">Percentage Calculator</span><br><br>
            Percentage Calculator is my personal favorite when it comes to design. Since the moment I started developing it, I knew an app with such simplicity would require a sleek, minimal and beautiful design. I made this app with this concept and the result was splendid. The app is free on the App Store and you can visit it <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/percentage-calculator-free/id1031751165?mt=8"><i>here</i></a>.
